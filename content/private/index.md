# Information about me

I like to play games watch movies and series. And I think that I am an active person with the drive to solve problems in my work or help my teammates solve theirs

What I want to do as a DEVOPS engineer is to create solutions for easier deploys to my teammates and my employee because the better you plan a release or deploy the better you can take the problems that may arise in the instance that they happen and take a better course of action to solve them with said plan.
